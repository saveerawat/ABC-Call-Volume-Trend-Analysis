# ABC-Call-Volume-Trend-Analysis
A Customer Experience (CX) team plays a crucial role in a company. They analyze customer feedback and data, derive insights from it, and share these insights with the rest of the organization. This team is responsible for a wide range of tasks, including managing customer experience programs, handling internal communications, mapping customer journeys, and managing customer data, among others.

Provided was a dataset that contains information about the inbound calls received by a company named ABC, which operates in the insurance sector. The task was to use this data to answer the following questions:

1. Average Call Duration: Determine the average duration of all incoming calls received by agents. This should be calculated for each time bucket.
Your Task: What is the average duration of calls for each time bucket?

2. Call Volume Analysis: Visualize the total number of calls received. This should be represented as a graph or chart showing the number of calls against time. Time should be represented in buckets (e.g., 1-2, 2-3, etc.).
Your Task: Can you create a chart or graph that shows the number of calls received in each time bucket?

3. Manpower Planning: The current rate of abandoned calls is approximately 30%. Propose a plan for manpower allocation during each time bucket (from 9 am to 9 pm) to reduce the abandon rate to 10%. In other words, you need to calculate the minimum number of agents required in each time bucket to ensure that at least 90 out of 100 calls are answered.
Your Task: What is the minimum number of agents required in each time bucket to reduce the abandon rate to 10%?

4. Night Shift Manpower Planning: Customers also call ABC Insurance Company at night but don't get an answer because there are no agents available. This creates a poor customer experience. Assume that for every 100 calls that customers make between 9 am and 9 pm, they also make 30 calls at night between 9 pm and 9 am. The distribution of these 30 calls is as follows:
Your Task: Propose a manpower plan for each time bucket throughout the day, keeping the maximum abandon rate at 10%.

Assumptions: An agent works for 6 days a week; On average, each agent takes 4 unplanned leaves per month; An agent's total working hours are 9 hours, out of which 1.5 hours are spent on lunch and snacks in the office. On average, an agent spends 60% of their total actual working hours (i.e., 60% of 7.5 hours) on calls with customers/users. The total number of days in a month is 30.
